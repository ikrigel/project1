Hi,
This is my first project in JS.
In order to make the best of this application Do the following - 
1) Please enter your required valued, and then click on "Save Draft".
2) After clicking on save draft, Please click on "Add note" button.
3) Clicking on "Add note" button will show a Fade In animation effect for the note apperance.
4)The Animation won't work without "Save Draft". Not clear why.
Thanks for your support.
Igal.
